# testing_and_tdd

## Description
Dive deep into testing with the codebase of your choice.

Apply common testing patterns and techniques to practice this essential skill. Practice writing different kinds of tests and doing test-driven development.

Concept focus goals like this one have some unique characteristics. If this is your first time working on one, read the Context for more information.

In working on this goal, you should explore concepts like:

unit, integration, and functional testing
test coverage
test-driven development
testing happy/sad/bad paths
For guidance and support, start with the Resources provided.
